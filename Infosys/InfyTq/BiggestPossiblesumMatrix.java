//Given a list on 1d array : 10,20,-30,70,60,30,-40,10,60,90,2 (some 11 elements)
//
//
//        Formulate the possible num of  biggest possible square matrix of order m*m out of it here 3*3 {since 11 elements h to
//        Possible 3*3 matrix between 1-9 , 2-10, 3-11}  then compute some of both the longest diagonal, {left diagonal and right diagonal}
//
//        Then if sum of any two diagonals in two different matrix is same as the longest for eg left diag of mat1 = 140 and also sum of right diag of mat2 =140 then choose that matrix which has its elements appearance in first in the given array
//
//        After choosing only such matrix rotate its columns to right -> direction for n times (where n is last element in the given input array ) here '2'
//
//
//        That if choosed array is
//        11 12 13
//        21 22 23
//        31 32 33
//
//        After n =2 rotations of column its output will be->
//        -->
//        12 13 11
//        22 23 21
//        32 33 31
